(current authed user shall be owner, if no owner is mentioned)

it only comes to my notice after writing the viewset and urls and testing  using browsable api the user creation post doesnt have field for password and login has unnesesary fields like email first_name last_name but not password


class TView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        token = request.COOKIES.get('jwt')

        if not token:

        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.SECRET_KEY, algorithms=['HS256'])
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            raise AuthenticationFailed('Unauthenticated!')

        user = User.objects.get(id=payload['user_id'])
        serializer = UserSerializer(user)
        return Response(serializer.data)
